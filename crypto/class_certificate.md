##Class: Certificate

SPKAC is a Certificate Signing Request mechanism originally implemented by
Netscape and now specified formally as part of [HTML5's `keygen` element][].

The `crypto` module provides the `Certificate` class for working with SPKAC
data. The most common usage is handling output generated by the HTML5
`<keygen>` element. Node.js uses [OpenSSL's SPKAC implementation][] internally.
