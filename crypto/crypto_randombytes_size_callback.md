###crypto.randomBytes(size[, callback])

Generates cryptographically strong pseudo-random data. The `size` argument
is a number indicating the number of bytes to generate.

If a `callback` function is provided, the bytes are generated asynchronously
and the `callback` function is invoked with two arguments: `err` and `buf`.
If an error occurs, `err` will be an Error object; otherwise it is null. The
`buf` argument is a [`Buffer`][] containing the generated bytes.

```js
// Asynchronous
const crypto = require('crypto');
crypto.randomBytes(256, (err, buf) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(`${buf.length} bytes of random data: ${buf.toString('hex')}`);
});
```

If the `callback` function is not provided, the random bytes are generated
synchronously and returned as a [`Buffer`][]. An error will be thrown if
there is a problem generating the bytes.

```js
// Synchronous
const buf = crypto.randomBytes(256);
console.log(
  `${buf.length} bytes of random data: ${buf.toString('hex')}`);
```

The `crypto.randomBytes()` method will block until there is sufficient entropy.
This should normally never take longer than a few milliseconds. The only time
when generating the random bytes may conceivably block for a longer period of
time is right after boot, when the whole system is still low on entropy.
