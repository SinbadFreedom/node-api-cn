###worker.kill([signal='SIGTERM'])
* `signal` {String} Name of the kill signal to send to the worker
  process.

This function will kill the worker. In the master, it does this by disconnecting
the `worker.process`, and once disconnected, killing with `signal`. In the
worker, it does it by disconnecting the channel, and then exiting with code `0`.

Causes `.exitedAfterDisconnect` to be set.

This method is aliased as `worker.destroy()` for backwards compatibility.

Note that in a worker, `process.kill()` exists, but it is not this function,
it is [`kill`][].
