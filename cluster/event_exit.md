###Event: 'exit'

* `code` {Number} the exit code, if it exited normally.
* `signal` {String} the name of the signal (e.g. `'SIGHUP'`) that caused
  the process to be killed.

Similar to the `cluster.on('exit')` event, but specific to this worker.

```js
const worker = cluster.fork();
worker.on('exit', (code, signal) => {
  if (signal) {
    console.log(`worker was killed by signal: ${signal}`);
  } else if (code !== 0) {
    console.log(`worker exited with error code: ${code}`);
  } else {
    console.log('worker success!');
  }
});
```
