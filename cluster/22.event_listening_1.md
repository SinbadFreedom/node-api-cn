##Event: 'listening'

* `worker` {cluster.Worker}
* `address` {Object}

After calling `listen()` from a worker, when the `'listening'` event is emitted on
the server, a `'listening'` event will also be emitted on `cluster` in the master.

The event handler is executed with two arguments, the `worker` contains the worker
object and the `address` object contains the following connection properties:
`address`, `port` and `addressType`. This is very useful if the worker is listening
on more than one address.

```js
cluster.on('listening', (worker, address) => {
  console.log(
    `A worker is now connected to ${address.address}:${address.port}`);
});
```

The `addressType` is one of:

* `4` (TCPv4)
* `6` (TCPv6)
* `-1` (unix domain socket)
* `"udp4"` or `"udp6"` (UDP v4 or v6)
